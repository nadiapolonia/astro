      <h2>Our Mission Statement.</h2>
      <p class="mission-p">
        For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and
        perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes
        your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more
        valuable than those which divide us. It suddenly struck me that that
        tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one
        eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn’t feel like a
        giant. I felt very, very small. Science has not yet mastered prophecy.
        We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the
        next 10.
